# USBFXStack Middleware Library v1.3.1

See the [README.md](./README.md) and the [USBFXStack API Reference Manual](https://infineon.github.io/usbfxstack/api_reference_manual.html) for a complete description of the USBFXStack.


## Feature updates

- Provided a new API called `Cy_USBHS_App_IsChannelActive` to check whether any transfers are pending on USB High-Speed DataWire channel.
- Updated interrupt handling in the USB stack to allow Endpoint-0 OUT transfers to be handled completely from the callback function itself.


## Defect fixes

- Resolved potential throughput drop on the LVCMOS to USB data path seen on some FX2G3 devices.
- Corrected cases where debug output stops abruptly when the USB CDC interface is used for logging.
- Corrected sequence used to disable the USB PLL when in the USB 2.x suspended state.


## Known issues and limitations

None.
