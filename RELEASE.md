# USBFXStack Middleware Library v1.2.1

See the [README.md](./README.md) and the [USBFXStack API Reference Manual](./docs/api_reference_manual.html) for a complete description of the USBFXStack.


## Defect fixes

- Fixed implementation of the `Cy_LVDS_GpifSMControl()` function so that the GPIF waveform is not invalidated when being resumed
- Updated fault handler module to handle cases where FreeRTOS is disabled
- Fixed build warnings when compiling with GCC 14.2.1 toolchain

## Known issues and limitations

- The USB stack is not fully compliant with USB specification requirements for 20 Gbps (Gen2x2) devices and rare failures may be seen in link layer test cases. Such failures will be resolved in a subsequent release of the stack. Note that all compliance requirements for USB 2.x, 10 Gbps (Gen2x1), and 5 Gbps (Gen1x1) devices are already satisfied by this version of the stack


## Supported software and tools
